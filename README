Net/Amazon/RemoteCart version 0.02
==================================

RemoteCart is an interface to Amazon Web Services Remote Cart API,
built on Mike Schilli's Net::Amazon package.

RemoteCart is an attempt at a consistent and easy to use interface to
the Amazon remote cart API. I've tried to make it work as closely as 
is practical to how someone (Ok, by someone I mean ME) would expect a 
shopping cart to work. It has methods to add, remove, fetch items, 
and modify their quantities based on the product's ASIN. 

See the POD documentation for more info.

INSTALLATION

This module requires the Net::Amazon package, which in turn 
requires Log::Log4perl, LWP::UserAgent, and XML::Simple 2.x

Once all dependencies have been resolved, "Net::Amazon::RemoteCart" installs 
with the typical sequence

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

LIVE TESTING 
    
(This works the same as for the main Net::Amazon package)
Results returned by Amazon can be incomplete or simply wrong at times,
due to their "best effort" design of the service. This is why the test
suite that comes with this module has been changed to perform its test
cases against canned data. If you want to perform the tests against the
live Amazon servers instead, just set the environment variable

    NET_AMAZON_LIVE_TESTS=1
